# Requirements

# Setup / Installation
1. [Install Homebridge]
2. `npm install homebridge-freeathome`
3. Edit `config.json` and configure platform. See [Configuration](#configuration) section.
4. Start Homebridge
5. Star the repository ;)

# Configuration
You can configure the plugin in [Homebridge Config UI X](https://github.com/oznu/homebridge-config-ui-x#readme) now:
![HomeKit UI](images/homebridge_ui_config.png)
Caveats: the mapping for blacklisted actuators doesn't work yet, since  *Homebridge Config UI X* demands a different json structure.

Of course you can configure the Plugin still raw in the `config.json`:

```json
{
    "platform": "free@home",
    "sysIP": "<IP>",
    "username": "<USERNAME>",
    "password": "<PASSWORD>",
    "isLocalAPI": <true|false>,
    "dimmActorMinValue": <0|100>,
    "mappings": {}
}
```

Replace `<IP>` with the IP of your System Access Point.

You can configure the *mappings* if you want to ignore an actuator or channel if they are not connected/unused to hide them from the HomeKit UI. However this is only needed in rare cases. Usually you can leave this blank.

```json
{
    "platform": "free@home",
    "sysIP": "<IP>",
    "username": "<USERNAME>",
    "password": "<PASSWORD>",
    "isLocalAPI": <true|false>,
    "dimmActorMinValue": <0|100>,
    "mappings": {
        "<ACTUATOR-SERIAL>": {
            "blacklist": ["ch0000", "ch0001"],
        },
        "<ACTUATOR-SERIAL>": {
            "blacklist": ["*"],
        }
    }
}
```

You can find the actuator serial in the web interface of the free@home SysAp Interface.

## Local REST API

You need to activate local API settings in the SysAP settings of the free@home next App: https://developer.eu.mybuildings.abb.com/fah_local/prerequisites/ 

This feature is NOT available in the web backend!

User/Password will be the same as for the Cloud API, the user "installer" seems to be the most reliable.

In your config.json you need to set `"isLocalAPI": true,`

That's it, good luck keeping your data at home!

## (Video) DoorBell
See the [DoorBell Tutorial](docs/DoorBellTutorial.md) on how to setup the free@home DoorBell in HomeKit.

## Garage Door
See the [GarageDoor Tutorial](docs/GarageDoorTutorial.md) on how to expose a Switch actuator as a GarageDoor accessory.

# Limitations
* ~~The door can not be controlled with HomeKit as the bus is not connected to the SysAp.~~
*Already implemented via free@HomeTouch 7 Panel*
* The door camera can not be accessed. You may want to use IP cameras that support the rtsp protocol and use
the video door bell.

# Notes
* The accessories can only be controlled when you're at home in your local WiFi network.
To manage your accessories remotely you need to setup an iPad/Homepod or Apple TV as a [Home Hub].

# Tips & Tricks
* Do not restart Homebridge if you are either updating the SysAp or an actuator as the accessory may be removed from
HomeKit if it is not detected during discovery.
