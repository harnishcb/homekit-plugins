## 0.7.0

  * Add Read Dry Contact Status commaands (`0x15CE`, `0x15CF`)

## 0.6.0

  * Allow to reuse same UDP address
  * Socket events on `Bus` instance
  * Enable UDP broadcast
  * Add address getter to `Device` instance
  * New API functions signature
  * Sender device decoupled from `Bus` class
  * Events on `Device` provides command object as a payload
  * `Channel` DSL removed
  * Keep command payload
  * Fix channels info for scene status commands (`0x0003`, `0xEFFF`)
  * Fix parsing of "Response Read Sensors Status" (`0x1605`)
  * Add Panel buttons control commands (`0xE012`, `0xE14E`)
  * Add AC Control commands (`0x193A`, `0x193B`)

**BREAKING:**

  - `bus.device()`, `bus.send()` and `device.send()` functions
    have new signature;
  - `device.send()` method now sends command **from** device
    to target;

    Refer to [`Send commands`](README.md#send-commands)
    readme section for details.

  - Now `Bus` object represents only and udp socket,
    sender device could be any device and must be initalized
    separately;

    Refer to [`Initialization`](README.md#initialization)
    readme section for details.

  - Events on `Device` instance have same payload as events on `Bus`;

  - `device.channel()` abstraction removed, listen for events manually;

    Refer to [`Complete example`](README.md#complete-example)
    readme section for details.
