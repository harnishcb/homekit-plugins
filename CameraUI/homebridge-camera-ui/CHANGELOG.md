# v5.0.25 - 2022-04-24

## Notable Changes
- **Config:** 
  - Added `"motionDelay"` parameter to the camera block. Motion Delay: The number of seconds to wait to trigger the motion sensor after a motion event is received from e.g. MQTT, SMTP, FTP or HTTP (this can be useful if you use an external motion sensor and the camera feed lags several seconds behind the event).

## Other Changes

# v5.0.23 - 2022-04-23

## Other Changes
- **MQTT:** When motion is detected, two MQTT messages are now published on following topics:
  1. **camera.ui/notifications**: Contains all notifications AFTER motion has been detected AND recorded.
  2. **camera.ui/motion** _(can be changed in the interface):_ Contains motion event (before something is recorded).
- Deprecated FFmpeg arguments will be auto replaced now
- Minor improvements to probe stream

## Bugfixes
- Fixed an issue where the recording process (HSV) was not terminated by the forceCloseTimer when motionTimeout was disabled

- Fixed an issue where disabling a camera in config.json also removed it from config.json
- Minor bugfixes

# v5.0.21 - 2022-04-23

## Notable Changes
- **Interface:**
  - **Recordings:** The recordings section has been redesigned and now includes another list mode to view the recordings. The filter function has been redesigned.
  - **Camera:** Added a new endpoint for direct streaming (`/cameras/:name/feed`)
  - **Cameras:** The cameras section has been redesigned and now includes another list mode to view the cameras.
  - **Notifications:** The filter function has been redesigned.
  - **Console:** Added a new filter function
  - **System:** Improved loading time (`npm`)
- **Config:** 
  - Top level `"debug"` in config.json is deprecated now. Replaced with `"logLevel"`. Log Level: Show only defined log level. _(Info = Show informative messages during processing. This is in addition to warnings and errors - Debug: Show everything, including debugging information - Warning: Show only warnings and errors - Error: Show only errors)_
  - Added `"hksvConfig"` to the camera block next to `"videoConfig"`. Here various parameters are defined for the HKSV recording process only, such as a different source, vcodec, acodec, etc.
  - Added `"disable"` parameter to the camera block. The parameter disables the camera and removes it from HomeKit.
- **MQTT:** When motion is detected, the messages are now also published via MQTT to the topic configured under `Settings > Cameras > Notifications > MQTT Publish Topic`

## Breaking Changes
- homebridge-camera-ui / camera.ui has been refactored and is now a ESM package.
  - **ATTENTION**: Windows users MUST update Homebridge to the current v1.4.0, otherwise you cannot use homebridge-camera-ui as it is NOT compatible with Homebridge < v1.4.0 (windows)

## Notable Changes
- homebridge-config-ui-x (config.schema.json)
  - `"unbridge"` is now set to `true` by default in config.schema.json ! If no `false` is entered in config for `"unbridge"`, then homebridge-config-ui-x will change it to `true` and on the next restart of Homebridge your **bridged** camera will be passed to Homebridge as **unbridged** (which is also recommended)!
- The database has been completely updated and will not be read/written again when the data is changed. Instead, any changes are cached and saved when logging out/restarting/closing camera.ui

## Other Changes
- Database: Changed to `@seydx/lowdb`
- Videoanalysis: It is now possible to set the internal "forceClose" timer for video analysis via the interface

- HSV: The warning that a recording was canceled by HSV now contains a more understandable reason
- More translations
- Minor UI improvements
- Bump dependencies

## Bugfixes

- Fixed an issue where it sometimes happened that the recording process (hsv) was not closed.
- Fixed an issue where camera.ui took the user path instead of the homebridge storage path
- Fixed an issue where some values were set by default for config.json (homebridge-config-ui-x)
- Fixed an issue where recordings displayed an invalid date
- Fixed an issue where mapping mqtt messages failed
- Fixed an issue where references were obtained instead of (copied) values when reading from the database
- Fixed an issue where the "videoanalysis" image was not displayed
- Fixed a bug where a removed camera widget (when Snapshot was set) tried to refresh the image in the background even though the widget no longer existed.
- Fixed an issue where notification cleartimer not resetted if notification was removed
- When writing or reading from the database, unnecessary actions to the database are prevented (Windows: `EMFILE`)
- Pinned `"mqtt"` to v4.2.8 to fix `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded`
- Minor bugfixes

# v5.0.9 - 2022-01-17

Thank you for using camera.ui and to all who support this project! This version includes a huge restructuring of camera.ui including a completely redesigned user interface

[**camera.ui**](https://github.com/SeydX/camera.ui) is now available as a standalone project. It has been completely decoupled from Homebridge and can also be used as a standalone app.

**homebridge-camera-ui** is the connection between camera.ui and homebridge and should give users a beautiful interface and HomeKit support.

## Breaking Changes
- **Database**
  - Due to the extensive restructuring of **camera.ui** and the new design, the old database is no longer compatible and will be recreated after updating and rebooting. Thereby already set configuration will be lost, and must be reconfigured after the first start!

## Notable Changes
- **Design**
  - The design of camera.ui has been redesigned from scratch and offers many new features for users. In addition to a dashboard with widgets, the settings page have also been completely overhauled. It is now also possible to add new cameras directly via the interface without having to restart Homebridge. Also most of the settings regarding Homebridge can be done via the interface without restarting Homebridge.
- **HomeKit Secure Video (HSV)**
  - Added HSV support for homebridge: HSV requires a home hub and iCloud plan with at least 200GB of storage.
  - Added HSV support for camera.ui: camera.ui can edit the recordings of HomeKit created by HSV. Thus, it is no longer possible to start a new recording when a movement is detected. All camera.ui functions are also available for recordings made by HSV.
- **Prebuffering**
  - Regardless of whether HSV is enabled or not, this option allows you to go back in time during recording up to 4 seconds to see the event BEFORE the movement. When HSV is enabled, the duration of the recording is completely determined by Apple Home.
- **Videoanalysis**
  - Motion detection system through camera.ui. Finally you can include cameras that can not detect motion, or simply was not compatible with camera.ui. The system is very resource efficient, accurate and very fast. You can also configure zones and adjust the sensivity within camera.ui interface
- **Notifications**
  - **Alexa:** It is now possible to send a motion notification with directly to Alexa. Thus, when motion is detected, a message with your own text message is sent to Alexa and Alexa plays that text back for you. Also, the speaker statement time can be set to not be disturbed at night. Adjustable in the interface settings.
  - The notifications have been completely reworked, now also system internal errors/warnings are displayed in the notifications page
- **Settings**
  - **System:** A new subpage called "System" has been added to Settings. Via this subpage it is possible to configure, restart or update camera.ui
- **Dashboard**
  - The dashboard has been redesigned from the ground up and now offers the ability to add numerous widgets of your own choosing to make your dashboard unique. Available Widgets:
    - Camera Feed
    - Clock
    - Weather
    - CPU Load, Temperature & Memory Usage
    - Notifications
    - RSS Feed
    - Log
    - Status
    - Uptime
    - Shortcuts
- **Utilization**
  - Added a new page to show the system load (CPU, memory) in graphs
- **Console**
  - Added a new endpoint to view the camera.ui log in realtime over the browser
- **Config**
  - Added a new endpoint to view/change the camera.ui config.json over the browser
- **Privacy Mode**
  - Added a new option to enable privacy mode for the cameras

## Other changes
- **Interface**

## Bugfixes
- Minor UI bugfixes

# v4.1.0 - 2021-05-04

## Notable changes
- **Livestreams**: Livestreams has been completely redesigned and fully integrated into the interface. There are NO more "**socketPorts**" necessary in config.json. Instead of opening a separate websocket server, the streams are bound to the interface's own server/socket.io where the streams all run over the same port but have their own "room" (e.g. `.../socket.io/stream/My Camera`). This change allows more control of the streams and are significantly more resource efficient.
  - **Developers' note**: Removing the socket ports and integrating the camera streams into the interface own server/socket.io has the reason that in the future camera.ui should also run with other homebridge plugins like "homebridge-camera-ffmpeg".

## Other changes
- Interface:
  - It is now possible to reload the stream on Dashboard/Camview if the stream could not be started due to an ffmpeg error etc. 
  - Changed icon from "change favourite camera" button (dashboard/camview)
  - Added animation to "change favourite camera" button
  - Changed theme color from `yellow` to `orange`
  - Minor UI improvements

## Bugfixes
- Fixed an issue where streams doesnt stop after changing stream settings
- Fixed an issue where the placeholder/fallback images not changed the color according to the current theme
- Fixed an issue where the snapshot timer displayed an incorrect value and therefore refreshed the image earlier than SHOULD have happened
- Fixed an issue where the console displayed a message that a new movement was detected even though the camera was still processing the "old" movement.
- Minor bugfixes

# v4.0.7 - 2021-05-03

## Notable Changes
- Added REST API (Documentation available at ``/swagger``)
- Preparations made so that the interface can also run without Homebridge
- "Backup & Restore" function is now included. You can easily download/restore the database AND the images
- HTTP/MQTT server for motion detection was separated and works independently from the plugin

  - Some settings that were accessible via config.json are now available via UI and not via config.json.
  - User "access authorization" has been completely rewritten. The "master" can create users and give/remove access permission for anything.
  - Contingent option has been added for image recognition in order to better control the number of image analyses.
- Server
  - Server was completely rewritten and new REST API endpoints were added.
  - Security has been increased.

# v3.3.0 - 2021-03-21
- **NEW:** Image Rekognition
  - Added Image Rekognition with Amazon Web Services to analyse, detect, remember and recognize objects, scenes, and faces in images. You can enable for each camera the image rekogniton and you can even set labels for each cam. For each object, scene, and concept the API returns one or more labels. Each label provides the object name. For example, suppose the input image has a lighthouse, the sea, and a rock. The response includes all three labels, one for each object.

  - Now it is possible that the image is sent immediately via Telegram without saving the image/video before. (Recording must be active under setting and Telegram must be set to 'Snapshot' for the camera).
